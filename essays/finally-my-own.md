## First Impressions
My perception of JavaScript thus far is that it is a complete, intuitive, and powerful programming language that is both fun to learn and less complicated than other programming languages, such as Java and C++. One aspect of the language that jumped out at me immediately was the fact that the language is dynamically typed, meaning that variables do not have to be declared with their type, such as int, String, or bool. JavaScript removes all of this tedium, replacing it with two simple and easy to remember keywords: let and const. JavaScript is also an appealing language to learn for me as an aspiring UI designer, as it interfaces naturally with HTML and CSS, which I have used previously in freelancing work to create websites in Joomla. Additionally, I find many of the new ES6 features to be appealing to use, including template literals, which make it easy to construct strings with embedded values, and arrow functions, which can save you from having to write the function keyword hundreds of times.

## Old Struggles - The Pandemic
While I find the JavaScript language appealing at first glance, at this moment in time, I would consider myself to be a relative newbie. My background is in Industrial Design, and I have mostly dabbled in programming up till this point. While I have taken other programming classes and learned both Java and C, I unfortunately was forced to learn these languages during the pandemic. To be completely honest, I feel as though the inability to attend in person classes, and to collaborate and practice with my peers has made it difficult for me to keep my programming skills sharp. As a result, I find that I have forgotten a great deal of my prior programming knowledge through social isolation, and the pandemic has made it difficult for me to learn and retain new information in general. Although this has meant that my initial attempts to learn JavaScript and the modern ES6 features has been a struggle thus far, I still find it to be more enjoyable than learning the more verbose and compiled languages such as Java and C/C++ that I studied previously. 

## New Struggles - DNFs
In addition to learning JavaScript, in the past week I have also been exposed to the athletic software engineering approach through the WODs (workouts of the day), which are timed programming challenges that seem akin to coding interview questions. I feel that going through the first few practice WODs has been a stressful experience for me, and I find myself getting really intimidated by the time constraints and the pressures to finish the challenge quickly. I have noticed that I keep running into mental blocks while completing these timed challenges which has led to more than a few DNF times. With that said, I’m sure that with more practice I will be able to overcome these difficulties and do well on the WODs. 

## Not Throwing in the Towel
If I had to give my overall impression of the athletic software engineering approach, I would say that while it has been stressful thus far, it is at the same time beneficial in that it is helping me to develop good practice habits, and to reinforce what I’m learning with spaced repetition. By challenging myself to solve these practice WODs and challenges numerous times, I feel as though I am better able to retain new information, while at the same time learning a lot from my mistakes, frustrations, and tribulations. I also find myself becoming more resilient and less prone to giving up or throwing in the towel early when things don’t work.

## Finally My Own
Ultimately, I think that learning JavaScript will yield significant benefits to me in my work, and I do feel as though I will use the language in the future. One thing I look forward to is the ability to finally program the behavior of my UI designs that I have been creating in Adobe Illustrator, whereas up until now, I have relied on other software developers to take my designs and build them programmatically with code. The potential to finally be able to combine my design skills and creativity with robust programming and computer science ability excites me. Finally, I feel like I will be able to own the UIs that I am developing throughout their entire life cycle, from initial mock-up all the way to final implementation and deployment in the end-user application, without relying on the skills of other developers.
