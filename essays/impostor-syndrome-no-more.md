## Initial Impressions
In describing my prior interests in software engineering, I can’t help but start by asking, “what the heck is software engineering?” To be honest, I didn’t know the answer to this question before enrolling in ICS 613. Now don’t get me wrong. While I am studying for a master’s degree in computer science, my background is in industrial design and my prior interests have been rooted in everything that has to do with art and creativity. Although I had heard the term “software engineering” tossed around a lot, I never really understood the difference between software engineering and other computer science disciplines, such as operating systems, networks, machine learning, AI, computer architecture, and computer vision. Isn’t it all just programming at the end of the day anyway? Well, I realize now that the obvious answer to that question is a definite “no.” While software engineering does involve a lot of programming, it goes beyond that by diving into how to design programs. As soon as the word “design” comes into the picture, I already find myself getting excited due to the joy that word brings me. Software engineering is also about dealing with the complex – again another word that I like. After all, what would life be without complexity to add spice to it?

## Inspiration Over Intimidation
Now that we have established the meaning of software engineering, let’s talk little about me and my past relationship with computer science, which up to this point I would describe as being minimal to non-existent. Just kidding. In truth, I have worked at the Laboratory for Advanced Visualization & Applications (LAVA), so I have been closely involved with this field. My lab mates are all amazing computer scientists, so as one of the only designers there, it’s safe to say that I felt a little intimidated at first. However, in time I was inspired by what they were able to create, so I decided that I wanted to learn the same skills that they have, instead of remaining as just a designer. 

## Impostor Syndrome Setting In
During my involvement with the energy table project, I experienced what it’s like to design the aesthetics of a UI, and it felt good when I saw my design come to life in the touch screen display. Despite this, creating this design in Adobe Illustrator was a bittersweet experience. While I was proud of the aesthetics of my design, my inability to program its functionality myself meant that I had to have a coworker do it for me, which didn’t feel good. In my past work as an industrial designer, I learned that nothing compares to the feeling of creating a design and then implementing it yourself. The rush that you get when you can say “that’s my baby, I built it myself!” is difficult to replicate. When it came to my UI work on the energy table, I found that I instead felt hollow, as though the final product wasn’t my own (talk about impostor syndrome).  

## Impostor Syndrom No More!
My desire to learn software engineering is rooted partially in these experiences. I want to be able to create my own design and program its functionality, from start to finish. I want to learn the skills that I need to shed my impostor syndrome, and to be able to feel like I own my projects. However, my interest in this discipline is about more than just getting the recognition or the feeling that I’ve accomplished a software design from start to finish. Learning software engineering will also help me to develop professionally and grow into the person that I want to be in the future. I will be a more well-rounded person, and the scope of my creativity won’t be limited to the mock-up phase. The potential to be able to unleash my creativity and combine my design background with computer science to create functional software systems with good aesthetics excites me, and I am eager to continue on this journey.
