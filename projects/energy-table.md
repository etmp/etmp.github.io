The Energy Table shows three ways of moving Hawaiʻi to 100% renewable by 2045, and the tradeoffs that need to be made with respect to land use.

This project was developed by the Laboratory for Advanced Visualization & Applications (LAVA) and funded in part by the Hawaiian Electric Company, Hawaiʻi State Energy Office, and the National Science Foundation.

My role in this project has been three-fold. To begin with, I was responsible for designing the aesthetics and visual layout of user interface for the interactive touch display. This touch display is used to interact with the energy table, and manipulate and toggle the various data layers that are displayed on a physical model of the island of Oahu. Additionally, I was put in charge of researching and procuring the necessary staging equipment for the display design of the energy table, including the truss assembly, stage, ambient lighting, projectors, projectable fabric, touch-screen display, and materials. I was also heavily involved in the purchasing process, which involved contacting sales representatives at various vendors, and researching and finding suitable equipment and solutions for the physical display components of the project, while keeping the components within the lab's budget.
